- <b>Solo Passion Project: Whisker's Wild Run! (*Working Title*)</b>
  - **Description:** Currently in the early stages of development, "Whisker's Wild Run!" is an ongoing passion project. The core concept revolves around skillful maneuvering and strategic decision-making. As the project evolves, the aim is to refine the platforming mechanics and enhance the overall gaming experience. While it's still taking shape, the goal is to create a short but fun platformer that I can feel proud of.
  - **Stay tuned for updates on the progress of Whisker's Wild Run! as it evolves from its initial stages into a polished and fully realized game.**

- <b>Done a course to develop my programming skills and knowledge about Unity: [Complete C# Unity Game Developer 2D](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse/)</b>
  - These projects, in essence, are not intended to showcase fully-fledged, polished games, but rather the progression of my skills and the dedication to continuous improvement. Each project, no matter how modest, contributes to the iterative process of honing my craft and gaining valuable experience.
